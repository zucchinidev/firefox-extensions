# Firefox extensions
In this repo I will create several extensions for Firefox, 
from start to finish.
### Borderify
The extension just adds a blue border to any pages loaded from "mozilla.org" or any of its subdomains.
### Beastify
The extension adds a new button to the Firefox toolbar. When the user clicks the button, we display a popup enabling them to choose an animal. Once they choose an animal, we'll replace the current page's content with a picture of the chosen animal.
